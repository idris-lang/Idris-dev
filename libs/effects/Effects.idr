||| The Effect type describes effectful computations.

||| This type is parameterised by:
||| + The input resource.
||| + The return type of the computation.
||| + The computation to run on the resource.
Effect : Type
Effect = (x : Type) -> Type -> (x -> Type) -> Type

||| The `EFFECT` Data type describes how to promote the Effect
||| description into a concrete effect.

data EFFECT : Type where
     MkEff : Type -> Effect -> EFFECT

||| Handler classes describe how an effect `e` is translated to the
||| underlying computation context `m` for execution.
class Handler (e : Effect) (m : Type -> Type) where
  ||| How to handle the effect.
  |||
  ||| @ r The resource being handled.
  ||| @ eff The effect to be applied.
  ||| @ k The continuation to pass the result of the effect
  covering handle : (r : res) -> (eff : e t res resk) ->

-- --------------------------------------------------------- [ Syntactic Sugar ]

-- A bit of syntactic sugar ('syntax' is not very flexible so we only go
-- up to a small number of parameters...)

-- No state transition
syntax "{" [inst] "}" [eff] = eff inst (\result => inst)

-- The state transition is dependent on a result `b`, a bound variable.
syntax "{" [inst] "==>" "{" {b} "}" [outst] "}" [eff]
       = eff inst (\b => outst)

--- A simple state transition
syntax "{" [inst] "==>" [outst] "}" [eff] = eff inst (\result => outst)
