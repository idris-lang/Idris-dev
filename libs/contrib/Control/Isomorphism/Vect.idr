||| Go through all possible inputs and tabulate the outputs in a `Vect`.

indexUnindex FZ _ = Refl
indexUnindex (FS k) f = rewrite indexUnindex k (f . FS) in Refl
||| Given a function `f`, a `Vect` `xs`, and a proof that calling `f` gives the same result as indexing into `xs`,
||| prove that `xs` is the table of outputs of `f`.

||| A simpler version of `unindexIndex'` which only proves that `unindex` is the inverse of `index`.

unindexIndex xs = unindexIndex' xs (\i => index i xs) (\i => Refl)

||| Given a function that computes an index in the input from the index in the output, produce a `Vect o` of elements from the input.
|||
||| This is the map function of the functor `\i => Vect i a` from `\i, o => Fin o -> Fin i` to `\i, o => Vect i a -> Vect o a`.
fromIndices : (Fin o -> Fin i) -> Vect i a -> Vect o a

indexFromIndices : (f : Fin o -> Fin i) -> (xs : Vect i a) -> (n : Fin o) -> index n (fromIndices f xs) = index (f n) xs
indexFromIndices f xs n = indexUnindex n (\i => index (f i) xs)
fromIndicesFromIndices : (to : Fin n -> Fin n) -> (from : Fin n -> Fin n) -> (fromTo : (i : Fin n) -> from (to i) = i) -> (xs : Vect n a) -> fromIndices to (fromIndices from xs) = xs
fromIndicesFromIndices to from fromTo xs = unindexIndex' xs (\x => index (to x) (unindex (\x' => index (from x') xs))) $ \i =>
                        rewrite indexUnindex (to i) (\x' => index (from x') xs) in rewrite fromTo i in Refl

||| Given a permutation of the indices, provide an `Iso` that can permute a `Vect n` the "same" way. More precisely,
||| if the index `i` is sent to `j`, then the element at index `i` ends up at index `j` (`indexPermuted`). An
||| `Iso (Fin n) (Fin n)` represents a permutation of the integers `[0, n)` because it ensures that no elements
||| are "lost" or "duplicated".
|||
||| Note this has the *opposite* behavior to `fromIndices`. This function is more "visceral"; it can be imagined
||| as shuffling a `Vect` in the same way `map (to permutation)` shuffles `range`. Or, in more categorical terms,
||| `fromIndices` represents a contravariant functor from the category `\i, o => Fin i -> Fin o` to `\i, o => Vect i a -> Vect o a`,
||| and `permuted` represents that functor restricted to isomorphisms and made covariant with `isoSym`.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| to (permuted (stimes 2 rotatedDown)) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] == [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
||| to (permuted (swapped 3 0))          [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] == [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
||| ```
|||
||| @ permutation an `Iso` representing the transformation on the indices
permuted : (permutation : Iso (Fin n) (Fin n)) -> Iso (Vect n a) (Vect n a)
-- [to, from => f from, f to] is not a typo
-- fromIndices needs a function outputIdx => inputIdx, so to "align" the "motion" of the Fins with the elements, to uses from and from uses to.
permuted (MkIso toI fromI toFromI fromToI) = MkIso (fromIndices fromI) (fromIndices toI) (fromIndicesFromIndices fromI toI toFromI) (fromIndicesFromIndices toI fromI fromToI)
permutedSym : (permutation : Iso (Fin n) (Fin n)) -> permuted (isoSym permutation) = isoSym (permuted permutation)
permutedSym (MkIso to from toFrom fromTo) = Refl
indexPermuted : (permutation : Iso (Fin n) (Fin n)) -> (i : Fin n) -> (xs : Vect n a) -> index i xs = index (to permutation i) (to (permuted permutation) xs)
indexPermuted (MkIso to from toFrom fromTo) i xs = replace {P = \xs' => index i xs' = index (to i) (fromIndices from xs) } (fromIndicesFromIndices to from fromTo xs) $
                                                   rewrite indexFromIndices to (fromIndices from xs) i in Refl
