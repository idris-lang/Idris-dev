-- Due to these being basically unused and difficult to implement,
-- they're in contrib for a bit. Once a design is found that lets them
-- be implemented for a number of implementations, and we get those
-- implementations, then some of them can move back to base (or even
-- prelude, in the cases of Functor, Applicative, Monad, Semigroup,
-- and Monoid).
