data LT' : (n,m : Nat) -> Type where

  LTSucc : LT' n (S n)

  LTStep : LT' n m -> LT' n (S m)

%name LT' lt, lt'

||| Nothing is strictly less than zero
implementation Uninhabited (LT' n 0) where
  uninhabited LTSucc impossible

||| Zero is less than any non-zero number.
LTZeroLeast : LT' Z (S n)
LTZeroLeast {n = Z}   = LTSucc
LTZeroLeast {n = S n} = LTStep LTZeroLeast

||| If n < m, then 1 + n < 1 + m
ltSuccSucc : LT' n m -> LT' (S n) (S m)

ltSuccSucc (LTStep lt) = LTStep $ ltSuccSucc lt

lteToLt' {n = Z}   (LTESucc x) = LTZeroLeast

||| Convert from LT' to LTE
ltToLTE : LT' n m -> LTE (S n) m
ltToLTE LTSucc      = lteRefl
ltToLTE (LTStep lt) = lteSuccRight $ ltToLTE lt

||| Subtraction gives a result that is actually smaller.

||| Strict less-than is well-founded, with the cascade stopping at
||| zero (because there's nothing less than zero). This can't be done
||| for LTE, because that one doesn't stop at zero (because `LTE 0 0`
||| is inhabited).

  wellFounded x = Access (acc x)
    where
      ||| Show accessibility by induction on the structure of the LT' witness
      acc : (x, y : Nat) -> LT' y x -> Accessible LT' y

      acc Z     y lt = absurd lt
      -- If the element being accessed is one smaller, we're done
      acc (S y) y LTSucc = Access (acc y)
      -- If the element is more than one smaller, we need to go further
      acc (S k) y (LTStep smaller) = acc k y smaller
