||| The erasure monad.

||| Used when explicit modelling of erasure in the type system is needed.
data Erased : Type -> Type where

    ||| Construct an erased value from any value.

implementation Functor Erased where
  map f (Erase x) = Erase (f x)

implementation Applicative Erased where

implementation Monad Erased where

||| Project the erased value out of the monad.
|||
||| This is usable only in types and other erased contexts,
||| where it won't cause erasure violations.
