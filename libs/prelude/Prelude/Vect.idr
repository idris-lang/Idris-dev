||| Calculate the length of a `Vect`.
|||
||| **Note**: this is only useful if you don't already statically know the length
||| and you want to avoid matching the implicit argument for erasure reasons.
||| @ n the length (provably equal to the return value)
||| @ xs the vector
length : (xs : Vect n a) -> Nat
length [] = 0
length (x::xs) = 1 + length xs
