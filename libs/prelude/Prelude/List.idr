-- Maps

  foldr c n [] = n
  foldr c n (x::xs) = c x (foldr c n xs)

  foldl f q [] = q
  foldl f q (x::xs) = foldl f (f q x) xs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Special folds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Convert any Foldable structure to a list.
toList : Foldable t => t a -> List a
toList = foldr (::) []

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Scans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| The scanl function is similar to foldl, but returns all the intermediate
||| accumulator states in the form of a list.
|||
|||````idris example
|||scanl (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]
|||````
scanl : (b -> a -> b) -> b -> List a -> List b
scanl f q []      = [q]
scanl f q (x::xs) = q :: scanl f (f q x) xs

||| The scanl1 function is a variant of scanl that doesn't require an explicit
||| starting value.
||| It assumes the first element of the list to be the starting value and then
||| starts the fold with the element following it.
|||
|||````idris example
|||scanl1 (+) [1,2,3,4]
|||````
scanl1 : (a -> a -> a) -> List a -> List a
scanl1 _ []      = []
scanl1 f (x::xs) = scanl f x xs

-- Transformations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Reverse a list onto an existing tail.
reverseOnto : List a -> List a -> List a
reverseOnto acc [] = acc
reverseOnto acc (x::xs) = reverseOnto (x::acc) xs

||| Return the elements of a list in reverse order.
reverse : List a -> List a
reverse = reverseOnto []

||| Insert some separator between the elements of a list.
|||
||| ````idris example
||| with List (intersperse ',' ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
||| ````
|||
intersperse : a -> List a -> List a
intersperse sep []      = []
intersperse sep (x::xs) = x :: intersperse' sep xs
  where
    intersperse' : a -> List a -> List a
    intersperse' sep []      = []
    intersperse' sep (y::ys) = sep :: y :: intersperse' sep ys

||| Given a separator list and some more lists, produce a new list by
||| placing the separator between each of the lists.
|||
||| @ sep the separator
||| @ xss the lists between which the separator will be placed
intercalate : (sep : List a) -> (xss : List (List a)) -> List a
intercalate sep xss = concat $ intersperse sep xss

||| Transposes rows and columns of a list of lists.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| with List transpose [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
||| ```
|||
||| This also works for non square scenarios, thus
||| involution does not always hold:
|||
|||     transpose [[], [1, 2]] = [[1], [2]]
|||     transpose (transpose [[], [1, 2]]) = [[1, 2]]
|||
||| TODO: Solution which satisfies the totality checker?
transpose : List (List a) -> List (List a)
transpose [] = []
transpose ([] :: xss) = transpose xss
transpose ((x::xs) :: xss) = assert_total $ (x :: (mapMaybe head' xss)) :: (transpose (xs :: (map (drop 1) xss)))

elemIndices : Eq a => a -> List a -> List Nat
elemIndices = elemIndicesBy (==)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Filters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| filter, applied to a predicate and a list, returns the list of those
||| elements that satisfy the predicate; e.g.,
|||
||| ````idris example
||| filter (< 3) [Z, S Z, S (S Z), S (S (S Z)), S (S (S (S Z)))]
||| ````
|||
filter : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
filter p []      = []
filter p (x::xs) =
  if p x then
    x :: filter p xs
  else
    filter p xs

||| A filtered list is no longer than its input
filterSmaller : (xs : _) -> LTE (length (filter p xs)) (length xs)
filterSmaller [] = LTEZero
filterSmaller {p} (x :: xs) with (p x)
  filterSmaller {p = p} (x :: xs) | False = lteSuccRight (filterSmaller xs)
  filterSmaller {p = p} (x :: xs) | True = LTESucc (filterSmaller xs)


||| The nubBy function behaves just like nub, except it uses a user-supplied
||| equality predicate instead of the overloaded == function.
nubBy : %static (a -> a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
nubBy = nubBy' []
  where
    nubBy' : List a -> (a -> a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
    nubBy' acc p []      = []
    nubBy' acc p (x::xs) =
      if elemBy p x acc then
        nubBy' acc p xs
      else
        x :: nubBy' (x::acc) p xs

||| O(n^2). The nub function removes duplicate elements from a list. In
||| particular, it keeps only the first occurrence of each element. It is a
||| special case of nubBy, which allows the programmer to supply their own
||| equality test.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| nub (the (List _) [1,2,1,3])
||| ```
nub : Eq a => List a -> List a
nub = nubBy (==)

||| The deleteBy function behaves like delete, but takes a user-supplied equality predicate.
deleteBy : %static (a -> a -> Bool) -> a -> List a -> List a
deleteBy _  _ []      = []
deleteBy eq x (y::ys) = if x `eq` y then ys else y :: deleteBy eq x ys

||| `delete x` removes the first occurrence of `x` from its list argument. For
||| example,
|||
|||````idris example
|||delete 'a' ['b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a']
|||````
|||
||| It is a special case of deleteBy, which allows the programmer to supply
||| their own equality test.
delete : (Eq a) => a -> List a -> List a
delete = deleteBy (==)

||| The `\\` function is list difference (non-associative). In the result of
||| `xs \\ ys`, the first occurrence of each element of ys in turn (if any) has
||| been removed from `xs`, e.g.,
|||
||| ```idris example
||| (([1,2] ++ [2,3]) \\ [1,2])
||| ```
(\\) : (Eq a) => List a -> List a -> List a
(\\) =  foldl (flip delete)

||| The unionBy function returns the union of two lists by user-supplied equality predicate.
unionBy : %static (a -> a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a -> List a
unionBy eq xs ys = xs ++ foldl (flip (deleteBy eq)) (nubBy eq ys) xs

||| Compute the union of two lists according to their `Eq` implementation.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| union ['d', 'o', 'g'] ['c', 'o', 'w']
||| ```
|||
union : (Eq a) => List a -> List a -> List a
union = unionBy (==)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Splitting and breaking lists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Given a list and a predicate, returns a pair consisting of the longest
||| prefix of the list that satisfies a predicate and the rest of the list.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| span (<3) [1,2,3,2,1]
||| ```
span : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> (List a, List a)
span p []      = ([], [])
span p (x::xs) =
  if p x then
    let (ys, zs) = span p xs in
      (x::ys, zs)
  else
    ([], x::xs)

||| Given a list and a predicate, returns a pair consisting of the longest
||| prefix of the list that does not satisfy a predicate and the rest of the
||| list.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| break (>=3) [1,2,3,2,1]
||| ```
break : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> (List a, List a)
break p = span (not . p)

||| Split on any elements that satisfy the given predicate.
|||
||| ```idris example
||| split (<2) [2,0,3,1,4]
||| ```
split : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List (List a)
split p xs =
  case break p xs of
    (chunk, [])          => [chunk]
    (chunk, (c :: rest)) => chunk :: split p (assert_smaller xs rest)

||| A tuple where the first element is a `List` of the `n` first elements and
||| the second element is a `List` of the remaining elements of the original.
||| It is equivalent to `(take n xs, drop n xs)` (`splitAtTakeDrop`),
||| but is more efficient.
|||
||| @ n   the index to split at
||| @ xs  the `List` to split in two
splitAt : (n : Nat) -> (xs : List a) -> (List a, List a)
splitAt Z xs = ([], xs)
splitAt (S k) [] = ([], [])
splitAt (S k) (x :: xs) with (splitAt k xs)
  | (tk, dr) = (x :: tk, dr)

||| The partition function takes a predicate a list and returns the pair of
||| lists of elements which do and do not satisfy the predicate, respectively;
||| e.g.,
|||
||| ```idris example
||| partition (<3) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
||| ```
partition : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> (List a, List a)
partition p []      = ([], [])
partition p (x::xs) =
  let (lefts, rights) = partition p xs in
    if p x then
      (x::lefts, rights)
    else
      (lefts, x::rights)

||| The inits function returns all initial segments of the argument, shortest
||| first. For example,
|||
||| ```idris example
||| inits [1,2,3]
||| ```
inits : List a -> List (List a)
inits xs = [] :: case xs of
  []        => []
  x :: xs'  => map (x ::) (inits xs')

||| The tails function returns all final segments of the argument, longest
||| first. For example,
|||
||| ```idris example
||| tails [1,2,3] == [[1,2,3], [2,3], [3], []]
|||```
tails : List a -> List (List a)
tails xs = xs :: case xs of
