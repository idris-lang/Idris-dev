  ||| Dependent pairs
  |||
  ||| Dependent pairs represent existential quantification - they consist of a
  ||| witness for the existential claim and a proof that the property holds for
  ||| it. Another way to see dependent pairs is as just data - for instance, the
  ||| length of a vector paired with that vector.
  |||
  |||  @ a the type of the witness
  |||  @ P the type of the proof

||| Use `void` or `absurd` to prove anything if you have a variable of type `Void` in scope.
