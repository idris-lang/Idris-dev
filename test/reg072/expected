DoubleEquality.idr:4:87:When checking right hand side of oops with expected type
        Void

When checking argument value to function Prelude.Basics.the:
        Type mismatch between
                x = x (Type of Refl)
        and
                (-0.0) = 0.0 (Expected type)
        
        Specifically:
                Type mismatch between
                        -0.0
                and
                        0.0
