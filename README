Idris (http://idris-lang.org/) is an experimental functional programming 
language with dependent types.

To configure, edit config.mk. The default values should work for most people.

To install, type 'make'. This will install everything using cabal and
typecheck the libraries.

To run the tests, type 'make test' which will execute the test suite, and
'make relib', which will typecheck and recompile the standard library.
