This file provides information over obtaining and installing Idris.

## Installing Idris from Hackage

This repository represents the latest development version of the language,
and may contain bugs that are being actively worked on.
For those who wish to use a more stable version of Idris please consider
installing the latest version that has been released on Hackage.
Installation instructions for various platforms can be [found on the Idris Wiki](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Installation-Instructions).

## Installing Development Versions

If you like to work against the latest development version, please consider
using Cabal Sandboxes to minimise disruption to your local Haskell setup.
Instructions for installing Idris HEAD within a cabal sandbox are
[available on the Idris Wiki](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Installing-an-Idris-Development-version-in-a-sandbox).

To configure, edit config.mk. The default values should work for most people.

Idris is built using a Makefile common targets include:

* `make` This will install everything using cabal and
typecheck the libraries.
* `make test` This target execute the test suite.
* `make relib` This target will typecheck and recompile the standard library.

Idris has an optional buildtime dependency on the C library
`libffi`. If you would like to use the features that it enables, make
sure that it is compiled for the same architecture as your Haskell
compiler (e.g. 64 bit libraries for 64 bit ghc). By default, Idris
builds without it. To build with it, pass the flag `-f FFI`.

A secondary optional buildtime dependency is on `libGMP`, this allows
better support for numeric operations. As with `libFFI` Idris builds
with out it, to enable `GMP` support use the flag `-f GMP`

To build with `libffi` and `libGMP` by default, create a `custom.mk` file and add the
following line to it:

`CABALFLAGS += -f FFI -f GMP`

The file `custom.mk-alldeps` is a suitable example.

The continuous integration builds on travis-ci.org are built using the
ghc-flag -Werror. To enable this behaviour locally also, please compile
using `make CI=true` or adding the following line into `custom.mk`:

`CI = true`

If you are only compiling for installing the most current version, you can
omit the CI flag, but please make sure you use it if you want to contribute.

## Experimental Support for Building with Stack

[Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) is a new
cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects, that enhances
the functionality provided by Cabal. There is experimental support for
building Idris from source using with stack, that uses a nightly
version of stackage dated `2015-09-22`, and has been tested on Ubuntu
14.04 LTS, only.

To build Idris with stack the following commands are recommended:

* `stack build`

This will install Idris (and related executables) into `./local/bin/`
on Unix based systems and an appropriate place on Windows. If you
haven't used stack before this will also setup the related
infrastructure. For more information about Stack please visit the
[Stack website](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack).

### System GHC

The flag `--system-ghc` can be added to enforce use of your system's version of GHC.

### `libGMP` and `libFFI`

To build with support for `libGMP` and `libFFI` you need to pass build
commands for the Idris library either from the command line:

* `stack build --flag idris:GMP --flag idris:FFI`

or add the options `idris:GMP` and `idris:FFI` to the `stack.yaml`
file.
