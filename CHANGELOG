New in 0.9.19:
--------------
* The Show class has been moved into Prelude.Show and augmented with the method
  showPrec, which allows correct parenthesization of showed terms. This comes
  with the type Prec of precedences and a few helper functions.

New in 0.9.18:
--------------
* GHC 7.10 compatibility
* Add support for bundled toolchains.
* Strings are now UTF8 encoded in the default back end
* Idris source files are now assumed to be in UTF8, regardless of locale
  settings.
* Some reorganisation of primitives:
  + Buffer and BitVector primitives have been removed (they were not
    tested sufficiently, and lack a maintainer)
  + Float has been renamed 'Double' (Float is defined in the Prelude for
    compatibility)
  + Externally defined primitives and  operations now supported with 
    '%extern' directive, allowing back ends to define their own special 
    purpose primitives
  + Ptr and ManagedPtr have been removed and replaced with external primitives
* Add %hint function annotation, which allows functions to be used as
  hints in proof search for 'auto' arguments. Only functions which return
  an instance of a data or record type are allowed as hints.
* Syntax rules no longer perform variable capture. Users of effects will
  need to explicitly name results in dependent effect signatures instead
  of using the default name "result".
* Pattern-matching lambdas are allowed to be impossible. For example,
  Dec (2 = 3) can now be constructed with No $ \(Refl) impossible, instead of
  requiring a separate lemma.
* Case alternatives are allowed to be impossible:
  case Vect.Nil {a=Nat} of { (x::xs) impossible ; [] => True }
* The default Semigroup and Monoid instances for Maybe are now prioritised
  choice, keeping the first success as Alternative does. The version that
  collects successes is now a named instance.
* :exec REPL command now takes an optional expression to compile and run/show
* The return types of `Vect.findIndex`, `Vect.elemIndex` and
  `Vect.elemIndexBy` were changed from `Maybe Nat` to `Maybe (Fin n)`
* A new :browse command shows the contents of a namespace
* `{n} is syntax for a quotation of the reflected representation of the name
  "n". If "n" is lexically bound, then the resulting quotation will be for it,
  whereas if it is not, then it will succeed with a quotation of the unique
  global name that matches.
* New syntax for records that closely matches our other record-like structures:
  type classes. See the updated tutorial for details.
* Records can be coinductive. Define coinductive records with the "corecord"
  keyword.
* Type class constructors can be assigned user-accessible names. This is done
  using the same syntax as record constructors.
* if ... then ... else ... is now built-in syntax instead of being defined in
  a library. It is shown in REPL output and error messages, rather than its
  desugaring.
* The desugaring of if ... then ... else ... has been renamed to ifThenElse from
  boolElim. This is for consistency with GHC Haskell and scala-virtualized, and
  to reflect that if-notation makes sense with non-Bool datatypes.
* Agda-style semantic highlighting is supported over the IDE protocol.
* Experimental support for elaborator reflection. Users can now script the
  elaborator, for use in code generation and proof automation. This feature is
  still under rapid development and is subject to change without notice. See
  Language.Reflection.Elab and the %runElab constructs


New in 0.9.17:
--------------
* The --ideslave command line option has been replaced with a --ide-mode
  command line option with the same semantics.
* A new tactic "claim N TY" that introduces a new hole named N with type TY
* A new tactic "unfocus" that moves the current hole to the bottom of the
  hole stack
* Quasiquotation supports the generation of Language.Reflection.Raw terms
  in addition to Language.Reflection.TT. Types are used for disambiguation,
  defaulting to TT at the REPL.
* Language.Reflection.Quotable now takes an extra type parameter which
  determines the type to be quoted to. Instances are provided to quote
  common types to both TT and Raw.
* Library operators have been renamed for consistency with Haskell. In
  particular, Applicative.(<$>) is now Applicative.(<*>) and (<$>) is
  now an alias for Functor.map. Correspondingly, ($>) and (<$) have
  been renamed to (<*) and (*>). The cascading effects of this rename
  are that Algebra.(<*>) has been renamed to Algebra.(<.>) and
  Matrix.(<.>) is now Matrix.(<:>).
* Binding forms in DSL notation are now given an extra argument: a
  reflected representation of the name that the user chose.
  Specifically, the rewritten lambda, pi, and let binders will now get
  an extra argument of type TTName. This allows more understandable
  dynamic errors in DSL code and more readable code generation results.
* DSL notation can now be applied with $
* Added FFI_Export type which allows Idris functions to be exportoed and
  called from foreign code
* Instances can now have documentation strings.
* Type providers can have documentation strings.
* Unification errors now (where possible) contain information about provenance
  of a type
* New REPL command ":core TM" that shows the elaborated form of TM along with
  its elaborated type using the syntax of TT. IDE mode has a corresponding
  command :elaborate-term for serialized terms.
* Effectful and IO function names for sending data to STDOUT have been
  aligned, semantically.
    + `print` is now for putting showable things to STDOUT.
    + `printLn` is for putting showable things to STDOUT with a new line
    + `putCharLn` for putting a single character to STDOUT, with a new line.
* Classes can now be annotated with 'determining parameters' to say which
  must be available before resolving instances. Only determining parameters
  are checked when checking for overlapping instances.
* New package 'contrib' containing things that are less mature or less used
  than the contents of 'base'. 'contrib' is not available by default, so you
  may need to add '-p contrib' to your .ipkg file or Idris command line.
* Arguments to class instances are now checked for injectivity.
  Unification assumes this, so we need to check when instances are defined.

New in 0.9.16:
--------------
* Inductive-inductive definitions are now supported (i.e. simultaneously
  defined types where one is indexed by the other.)
* Implicits and type class constraints can now appear in scopes other than
  the top level.
* Importing a module no longer means it is automatically reexported. A new
  "public" modifier has been added to import statements, which will reexport
  the names exported from that module.
* Implemented @-patterns. A pattern of the form x@p on the left hand side
  matches p, with x in scope on the right hand side with value p.
* A new tactic sourceLocation that fills the current hole with the current
  source code span, if this information is available. If not, it raises an
  error.
* Better Unicode support for the JavaScript/Node codegen
* ':search' and ':apropos' commands can now be given optional package lists
  to search.
* Vect, Fin and So moved out of prelude into base, in modules Data.Vect,
  Data.Fin and Data.So respectively.
* Several long-standing issues resolved, particularly with pattern matching
  and coverage checking.
* Modules can now have API documentation strings.

New in 0.9.15:
--------------
* Two new tactics: skip and fail. Skip does nothing, and fail takes a string
  as an argument and produces it as an error.
* Corresponding reflected tactics Skip and Fail. Reflected Fail takes a list
  of ErrorReportParts as an argument, like error handlers produce, allowing
  access to the pretty-printer.
* Stop showing irrelevant and inaccessible internal names in the interactive
  prover.
* The proof arguments in the List library functions are now implicit and
  solved automatically.
* More efficient representation of proof state, leading to faster elaboration
  of large expressions.
* EXPERIMENTAL Implementation of uniqueness types
* Unary negation now desugars to "negate", which is a method of the Neg type class.
  This allows instances of Num that can't be negative, like Nat, and it makes correct
  IEEE Float operations easier to encode. Additionally, unary negation is now available
  to DSL authors.
* The Java and LLVM backends have been factored out for separate maintenance. Now, the
  compiler distribution only ships with the C and JavaScript backends.
* New REPL command :printdef displays the internal definition of a name
* New REPL command :pprint pretty-prints a definition or term with LaTeX or
  HTML highlighting
* Naming of data and type constructors is made consistent across the standard
  library (see #1516)
* Terms in `code blocks` inside of documentation strings are now parsed and
  type checked. If this succeeds, they are rendered in full color in
  documentation lookups, and with semantic highlighting for IDEs.
* Fenced code blocks in docs defined with the "example" attribute are rendered
  as code examples.
* Fenced code blocks declared to be Idris code that fail to parse or type check now
  provide error messages to IDE clients.
* EXPERIMENTAL support for partial evaluation (Scrapping your Inefficient
  Engine style)

New in 0.9.14:
--------------
* Tactic for case analysis in proofs
* Induction and case tactic now work on expressions
* Support for running tests for a package with the tests section of .ipkg files and the
  --testpkg command-line option
* Clearly distinguish between type providers and postulate providers at the use site
* Allow dependent function syntax to be overridden in dsl blocks, similarly to
  functions and let. The keyword for this is "pi".
* Updated 'effects' library, with simplified API
* All new JavaScript backend (avoids callstack overflows)
* Add support for %lib directive for NodeJS
* Quasiquotes and quasiquote patterns allow easier work with reflected terms.
  `(EXPR) quasiquotes EXPR, causing the elaborator to be used to produce a reflected
  version of it. Subterms prefixed with ~ are unquoted - on the RHS, they are reflected
  terms to splice in, while on the LHS they are patterns.
  A quasiquote expression can be given a goal type for the elaborator, which helps with
  disambiguation. For instance, `(() : ()) quotes the unit constructor, while `(() : Type)
  quotes the unit type.
  Both goal types and quasiquote are typechecked in the global environment.
* Better inference of unbound implicits

New in 0.9.13:
--------------
* IDE support for retrieving structured information about metavariables
* Experimental Bits support for JavaScript
* IdrisDoc: a Haddock- and JavaDoc-like HTML documentation generator
* Command line option -e (or --eval) to evaluate expressions without loading the
  REPL. This is useful for writing more portable tests.
* Many more of the basic functions and datatypes are documented.
* Primitive types such as Int and String are documented
* Removed javascript lib in favor of idris-hackers/iQuery
* Specify codegen for :compile REPL command (e.g. :compile javascript program.js)
* Remove :info REPL command, subsume and enhance its functionality in the :doc command
* New (first class) nested record update/access syntax:
  record { a->b->c = val } x -- sets field accessed by c (b (a x)) to val
  record { a->b->c } x -- accesses field, equivalent to c (b (a x))
* The banner at startup can be suppressed by adding :set nobanner to the initialisation script.
* :apropos now accepts space-delimited lists of query items, and searches for the conjunction
  of its inputs. It also accepts binder syntax as search strings - for instance, -> finds
  functions.
* Totality errors are now treated as warnings until code generation time, when they become
  errors again. This allows users to use the interactive editing features to fix totality
  issues, but no programs that violate the stated assumptions will actually run.
* Added :makelemma command, which adds a new top level definition to solve
  a metavariable.
* Extend :addclause to add instance bodies as well as definitions
* Reverse parameters to BoundedList -- now matches Vect, and is easier to instantiate classes.
* Move foldl into Foldable so it can be overridden.
* Experimental :search REPL command for finding functions by type

Internal changes

* New implementation of erasure

New in 0.9.12:
--------------

* Proof search now works for metavariables in types, giving some interactive
  type inference.
* New 'Lazy' type, replacing laziness annotations.
* JavaScript and Node codegen now understand the %include directive.
* Concept of 'null' is now understood in the JavaScript and Node codegen.
* Lots of performance patches for generated JavaScript.
* New commands :eval (:e) and :type (:t) in the prover, which either normalise
  or show the type of expressions.
* Allow type providers to return postulates in addition to terms.
* Syntax for dealing with match failure in <- and pattern matching let.
* New syntax for inline documentation. Documentation starts with |||, and
  arguments are documented by preceding their name with @. Example:
  ||| Add two natural numbers
  ||| @ n the first number (examined by the function)
  ||| @ m the second number (not examined)
  plus (n, m : Nat) -> Nat
* Allow the auto-solve behaviour in the prover to be disabled, for easier
  debugging of proof automation. Use ":set autosolve" and ":unset autosolve".
* Updated 'effects' library
* New :apropos command at REPL to search documentation, names, and types
* Unification errors are now slightly more informative
* Support mixed induction/coinduction with 'Inf' type
* Add 'covering' function option, which checks whether a function and all
  descendants cover all possible inputs

New in 0.9.11:
--------------

* Agda-style equational reasoning (in Syntax.PreorderReasoning)
* 'case' construct now abstracts over the scrutinee in its type
* Added label type 'name (equivalent to the empty type).
  This is intended for field/effect disambiguation. "name" can be any
  valid identifier. Two labels are definitionally equal if they have the
  same name.
* General improvements in error messages, especially %error_reverse
  annotation, which allows a hint as to how to display a term in error
  messages
* --ideslave mode now transmits semantic information about many of the
  strings that it emits, which can be used by clients to implement
  semantic highlighting like that of the REPL. This has been implemented
  in the Emacs mode and the IRC bot, which can serve as examples.
* New expression form: with NAME EXPR privileges the namespace NAME
  when disambiguating overloaded names. For example, it is possible to
  write "with Vect [1,2,3]" at the REPL instead of "the (Vect _ _) [1,2,3]",
  because the Vect constructors are defined in a namespace called Vect.
* assert_smaller internal function, which marks an expression as smaller than
  a pattern for use in totality checking.
  e.g. "assert_smaller (x :: xs) (f xs)" asserts that "f xs" will always be
  structurally smaller than "(x :: xs)"
* assert_total internal function, which marks a subexpression as assumed to
  be total, e.g "assert_total (tail (x :: xs))".
* Terminal width is automatically detected if Idris is compiled with curses
  support. If curses is not available, automatic mode assumes 80 columns.
* Changed argument order for Prelude.Either.either.
* Experimental 'neweffects' library, intended to replace 'effects' in the
  next release.

Internal changes

* Faster elaboration
* Smaller .ibc files
* Pretty-printer now used for all term output


New in 0.9.10:
--------------

* Type classes now implemented as dependent records, meaning that method
  types may now depend on earlier methods.
* More flexible class instance resolution, so that function types and lambda
  expressions can be made instances of a type class.
* Add !expr notation for implicit binding of intermediate results in
  monadic/do/etc expressions.
* Extend Effects package to cope with possibly failing operations, using
  "if_valid", "if_error", etc.
* At the REPL, "it" now refers to the previous expression.
* Semantic colouring at the REPL. Turn this off with --nocolour.
* Some prettifying of error messages.
* The contents of ~/.idris/repl/init are run at REPL start-up.
* The REPL stores a command history in ~/.idris/repl/history.
* The [a..b], [a,b..c], [a..], and [a,b..] syntax now pass the totality
  checker and can thus be used in types. The [x..] syntax now returns an
  actually infinite stream.
* Add '%reflection' option for functions, for compile-time operations on
  syntax.
* Add expression form 'quoteGoal x by p in e' which applies p to the expected
  expression type and binds the result to x in the scope e.
* Performance improvements in Strings library.
* Library reorganisation, separated into prelude/ and base/.

Internal changes

* New module/dependency tree checking.
* New parser implementation with more precise errors.
* Improved type class resolution.

* Improvements in termination checking.
* Various REPL commands to support interactive editing, and a client/server
  mode to allow external invocation of REPL commands.

New in 0.9.9:
-------------

* Apply functions by return type, rather than with arguments:
  "t <== f" means "apply f with arguments such that it returns a value
  of type t"
* Allow the result type of a rewrite to be specified
* Allow names to be attached to provisional definitions
  lhs ?= {name} rhs -- generates a lemma called 'name' which makes the
  types of the lhs and rhs match. {name} is optional - a unique name is
  generated if it is absent.
* Experimental LLVM backend
* Added Data.HVect module
* Fix fromInteger to take an Integer, rather than an Int
* Integer literals for Fin
* Renamed O to Z, and fO to fZ
* Swapped Vect arguments, now Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type

  - supporting induction recursion and mutually recursive data
* Type inference of definitions in 'where' clauses
  - Provided that the type can be completely determined from the first
    application of the function (in the top level definition)
* 'mutual' blocks added
  - effect is to elaborate all types of declarations in the block before
    elaborating their definitions
  - allows inductive-recursive definitions
* Expression inspected by 'with' clause now abstracted from the goal
  - i.e. "magic" with
* Implicit arguments will be added automatically only if their initial

  line options.
* Command line option "--warnpartial" for flagging all undeclared
  partial functions, without error.
* New termination checker supporting mutually recursive definitions.
