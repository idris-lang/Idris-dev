New in 0.9.7:
-------------

User visible changes:

* 'implicit' keyword, for implicit type conversion
* Primitives for 8,16,32 and 64 bit integers

Internal changes:

* Change unification so that it keeps track of failed constraints in case
  later information helps to resolve them
* Distinguishing parameters and indices in data types
* Faster termination/coverage checking
* Split 'javascript' target into 'javascript' and 'node'

New in 0.9.6:
-------------

User visible changes:

* The type of types is now 'Type' rather than 'Set'
* Forward declarations of data allowed
  - supporting induction recursion and mutually recursive data
* Type inference of definitions in 'where' clauses
  - Provided that the type can be completely determined from the first
    application of the function (in the top level definition)
* 'mutual' blocks added
  - effect is to elaborate all types of declarations in the block before
    elaborating their definitions
  - allows inductive-recursive definitions
* Expression inspected by 'with' clause now abstracted from the goal
  - i.e. "magic" with
* Implicit arguments will be added automatically only if their initial
  letter is lower case, or they are in a using declaration
* Added documentation comments (Haddock style) and ':doc' REPL command
* Pattern matching on strings, big integers and characters
* Added System.Concurrency modules
* Added 'postulate' declarations
* Allow type annotations on 'let' tactic
* EXPERIMENTAL JavaScript generation, with '--target javascript' option

Internal changes:

* Separate inlining methods at compile-time and run-time
* Fixed nested parameters blocks 
* Improve efficiency of elaborator by:
   - only normalising when necessary
   - reducing backtracking with resolving ambiguities
* Better compilation of case trees

New in 0.9.5:
-------------

User visible changes:

* Added codata
  - as data declarations, but constructor arguments are evaluated lazily
  - functions which return a codata type do not reduce at compile time
* Added 'parameters' blocks
* Allow local data definitions in where blocks
* Added '%default' directive to declare total-by-default or partial-by-default
  for functions, and a corresponding "partial" reserved words to mark functions
  as allowed to be partial. Also "--total" and "--partial" added as command
  line options.
* Command line option "--warnpartial" for flagging all undeclared
  partial functions, without error.
* New termination checker supporting mutually recursive definitions.
* Added ':load' command to REPL, for loading a new file
* Added ':module' command to REPL, for adding modules
* Renamed library modules (now have initial capital)

Internal changes:

* Several improvements and fixes to unification
* Added collapsing optimisation and more aggressive erasure

New in 0.9.4:
-------------

User visible changes:

* Simple packaging system
* Added --dumpc flag for displaying generated code

Internal changes:

* Improve overloading resolution (especially where this is a type error)
* Various important bug fixes with evaluation and compilation
* More aggressive compile-time evaluation

New in 0.9.3:
-------------

User visible changes:

* Added binding forms to syntax rules
* Named class instances
* Added ':set' command, with options 'errorcontext' for displaying local
  variables in scope when a unification error occurs, and 'showimplicits'
  for displaying elaborated terms in full
* Added '--errorcontext' command line switch
* Added ':proofs' and ':rmproofs' commands
* Various minor REPL improvements and fixes

Internal changes:

* Completely new run time system (not based on Epic or relying on Boehm GC)
* Normalise before forcing to catch more forceable arguments
* Types no longer exported in normal form
* Try to resolve overloading by inspecting types, rather than full type
  checking

New in 0.9.2:
-------------

User visible changes:

* backtick notation added: x `foo` y  ==> foo x y
* case expressions allowed in type signatures
* Library extensions in prelude.vect and prelude.algebra
* malloc/trace_malloc added to builtins.idr

Internal changes:

* Some type class resolution fixes
* Several minor bug fixes 
* Performance improvements in resolving overloading and type classes

New in 0.9.1:
-------------

User visible changes:

* DSL notation, for overloading lambda and let bindings
* Dependent records, with projection and update
* Totality checking and 'total' keyword
* Auto implicits and default argument values {auto n : T}, {default val n : T}
* Overlapping type class instances disallowed
* Many extensions to prelude.nat and prelude.list libraries (mostly thanks to
  Dominic Mulligan)
* New libraries: control.monad.identity, control.monad.state
* Small improvements in error reporting

Internal changes:

* Faster compilation (only compiling names which are used)
* Better type class resolution
* Lots of minor bug fixes

0.1.x to 0.9.0:

Complete rewrite. User visible changes:

* New proof/tactics syntax
* New syntax for pairs/dependent pairs
* Indentation-significant syntax
* Added type classes
* Added where clauses
* Added case expressions, pattern matching let and lambda
* Added monad comprehensions
* Added cumulativity and universe checking
* Ad-hoc name overloading
  - Resolved by type or explicit namespace
* Modules (Haskell-style)
* public, abstract and private access to functions and types
* Separate type-checking
* Improved interactive environment
* Replaced 'do using' with Monad class
* Extended syntax macros

Internal changes:

* Everything :-)
* All definitions (functions, classes and instances) are elaborated to top 
  level, fully explicit, data declarations and pattern matching definitions, 
  which are verified by a minimal type checker. 

This is the first release of a complete reimplementation. There will be bugs.
