New in 0.9.11:
--------------

* Agda-style equational reasoning (in Syntax.PreorderReasoning)
* 'case' construct now abstracts over the scrutinee in its type
* Added label type 'name (equivalent to the empty type).
  This is intended for field/effect disambiguation. "name" can be any
  valid identifier. Two labels are definitionally equal if they have the
  same name.
* General improvements in error messages, especially %error_reverse
  annotation, which allows a hint as to how to display a term in error
  messages
* --ideslave mode now transmits semantic information about many of the
  strings that it emits, which can be used by clients to implement
  semantic highlighting like that of the REPL. This has been implemented
  in the Emacs mode and the IRC bot, which can serve as examples.
* New expression form: with NAME EXPR privileges the namespace NAME
  when disambiguating overloaded names. For example, it is possible to
  write "with Vect [1,2,3]" at the REPL instead of "the (Vect _ _) [1,2,3]",
  because the Vect constructors are defined in a namespace called Vect.
* assert_smaller internal function, which marks an expression as smaller than
  a pattern for use in totality checking. 
  e.g. "assert_smaller (x :: xs) (f xs)" asserts that "f xs" will always be
  structurally smaller than "(x :: xs)"
* assert_total internal function, which marks a subexpression as assumed to
  be total, e.g "assert_total (tail (x :: xs))".
* Terminal width is automatically detected if Idris is compiled with curses
  support. If curses is not available, automatic mode assumes 80 columns.
* Changed argument order for Prelude.Either.either.
* Experimental 'neweffects' library, intended to replace 'effects' in the
  next release.

Internal changes

* Faster elaboration
* Smaller .ibc files
* Pretty-printer now used for all term output


New in 0.9.10:
--------------

* Type classes now implemented as dependent records, meaning that method
  types may now depend on earlier methods.
* More flexible class instance resolution, so that function types and lambda
  expressions can be made instances of a type class.
* Add !expr notation for implicit binding of intermediate results in 
  monadic/do/etc expressions.
* Extend Effects package to cope with possibly failing operations, using
  "if_valid", "if_error", etc.
* At the REPL, "it" now refers to the previous expression.
* Semantic colouring at the REPL. Turn this off with --nocolour.
* Some prettifying of error messages.
* The contents of ~/.idris/repl/init are run at REPL start-up.
* The REPL stores a command history in ~/.idris/repl/history.
* The [a..b], [a,b..c], [a..], and [a,b..] syntax now pass the totality
  checker and can thus be used in types. The [x..] syntax now returns an
  actually infinite stream.
* Add '%reflection' option for functions, for compile-time operations on
  syntax.
* Add expression form 'quoteGoal x by p in e' which applies p to the expected
  expression type and binds the result to x in the scope e.
* Performance improvements in Strings library.
* Library reorganisation, separated into prelude/ and base/.

Internal changes

* New module/dependency tree checking.
* New parser implementation with more precise errors.
* Improved type class resolution.
* Compiling Nat via GMP integers.
* Performance improvements in elaboration.
* Improvements in termination checking.
* Various REPL commands to support interactive editing, and a client/server
  mode to allow external invocation of REPL commands.

New in 0.9.9:
-------------

* Apply functions by return type, rather than with arguments:
  "t <== f" means "apply f with arguments such that it returns a value
  of type t"
* Allow the result type of a rewrite to be specified
* Allow names to be attached to provisional definitions
  lhs ?= {name} rhs -- generates a lemma called 'name' which makes the
  types of the lhs and rhs match. {name} is optional - a unique name is
  generated if it is absent.
* Experimental LLVM backend
* Added Data.HVect module
* Fix fromInteger to take an Integer, rather than an Int
* Integer literals for Fin
* Renamed O to Z, and fO to fZ
* Swapped Vect arguments, now Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type
* Added DecEq instances
* Add 'equiv' tactic, which rewrites a goal to an equivalent (convertible) goal

* Add annotation for unification traces
* Add 'mrefine' tactic for refining by matching against a type
* Type class resolution fixes

* Split 'javascript' target into 'javascript' and 'node'

New in 0.9.6:
-------------

User visible changes:

* The type of types is now 'Type' rather than 'Set'

  - supporting induction recursion and mutually recursive data
* Type inference of definitions in 'where' clauses
  - Provided that the type can be completely determined from the first
    application of the function (in the top level definition)
* 'mutual' blocks added
  - effect is to elaborate all types of declarations in the block before
    elaborating their definitions
  - allows inductive-recursive definitions
* Expression inspected by 'with' clause now abstracted from the goal
  - i.e. "magic" with
* Implicit arguments will be added automatically only if their initial
  letter is lower case, or they are in a using declaration
* Added documentation comments (Haddock style) and ':doc' REPL command

  for functions, and a corresponding "partial" reserved words to mark functions

  partial functions, without error.
