This paper describes a solution, in Haskell, of the 2012 ICFP Programming Contest task, explaining in particular how Haskell's laziness and higher order functions helped to build a solution in limited time. I enjoyed reading this paper as an experience report - it provides evidence for the importance of high level features such as purity and laziness (for example when describing the GameTrie), and shows that Haskell can handle more realistic, practical, problems such as concurrency and exceptions (for example when dealing gracefully with timeout and communication between solving threads).

        
My main concern with the paper is that it reads as if the reader is already familiar with the contest task. It would be useful to be more precise about the task itself in the introduction, rather than by making it implicit from the code samples. Section 1.1 describes the problem, but only in general terms - I think it would be worth extending this, and correspondingly removing some of the code. In particular, 'stepRobot' and 'updRocks' would probably be fine just with their type signatures if the problem specification was more precise.

abstract = {We describe an axiomatic extension to the Coq proof assistant, that supports writing, reasoning about, and extracting higher-order, dependently-typed programs with side-effects. Coq already includes a powerful functional language that supports dependent types, but that language is limited to pure, total functions. The key contribution of our extension, which we call Ynot, is the added support for computations that may have effects such as non-termination, accessing a mutable store, and throwing/catching exceptions. The axioms of Ynot form a small trusted computing base which has been formally justified in our previous work on Hoare Type Theory (HTT). We show how these axioms can be combined with the powerful type and abstraction mechanisms of Coq to build higher-level reasoning mechanisms which in turn can be used to build realistic, verified software components. To substantiate this claim, we describe here a representative series of modules that implement imperative finite maps, including support for a higher-order (effectful) iterator. The implementations range from simple (e.g., association lists) to complex (e.g., hash tables) but share a common interface which, abstracts the implementation details and ensures that the modules properly implement the finite map abstraction.

This paper describes the use of Agda's reflection mechanism to help with proof automation, and gives some simple examples, including proving evenness of natural numbers and proving that a boolean formula is a tautology.

        
It seems that proof automation is important for a practical language with dependent types, and Agda's reflection mechanism as described is likely to help. However, this paper only really scratches the surface of what is possible - existing (unpublished, as far as I'm aware) examples such as the Ring solver go much further towards demonstrating its value.

        
The 'Evenness' example uses a lot of space for something pretty simple. An in practice, the number won't necessarily be known. What if you know "Even x" and need to prove "Even (x + 100)". Does it still work? Similarly for the tautology example - what if there is an unknown formula which is nevertheless known to be a tautology? It would be nice, therefore, to show how such proof obligations come up in practice and how the reflection techniques described help. Without this, it's not clear that the paper answers the given central question of whether Agda's reflective capabilities are sufficient and practically usable.

        
In summary: there's some nice tutorial material here describing reflection and its application, but I don't think there is enough depth for it to be really interesting.

        
Minor comments

        
The fonts and layout look wrong. Is this the proper LaTeX class? Also remember that the colour won't come out in print...

        
p2 "new" keywords seems wrong for a technique was has been aroundfor a couple of years. I know it hasn't been written up elsewhere, but I'd omit the word "new"

        
p3 "This is why we have decidable equality" - can you explain what you mean by this, for the non-Agda expert?

        
Vars are naturals - so they are de Bruijn indexed?

        
p5 "Other terms are rejected" - what does it mean for a term to be rejected? i.e. what is the effect? The text hints that this is a type error, since there is a suggestion that a proof is needed to show it is valid, but it would be good to be explicit.

        
p8 I'm not sure I'd go as far as to say it's "trivial" to show that (1) is a tautology, but I agree it should be easy, if tedious.},

@misc{Ferreira2012,
annote = {This paper explains how to compile Beluga, a programming language with higher order abstract syntax which is specifically designed to support data structures with binders. In particular, it aims to make it easy to reason about metatheory of programming languages by supporting name generation, alpha conversion and capture avoiding substitution.

        
In general, I liked this paper, primarily because it tackles an underrepresented problem - namely, taking a high level language with support for theorem proving and dependent types, and generating efficient executable code. This is clearly important if such high level languages are to be useful in practice, and even to demonstrate the usefulness and power of the language on anything other than small scale examples.

        
I think this paper can be accepted, though I have some small comments and suggestions for improvements:

        
The introductory example in section 2 provides a generally clear introduction to contextual objects, motivating the problem with a well-understood example. However, it would be nice to say more here about what the target of the compilation is (otherwise I'm not sure what you mean by using "simple names" here). You say: "The output is a fully annotated program using a representation close to the one presented by Cave and Pientka" - as well as the reference it would be very useful here to summarise what that representation is. There are a couple of instances of this, where some background is assumed, which would be good to explain in a couple of sentences in the early sections - e.g. it would also be useful to say what you mean by "Fresh-Style" earlier on.

        
Section 4 - maybe give the informal description of fresh binders earlier?

        
p6-7 On dependency erasure - "The compiler keeps the simple types as a way of sanity check" - is this always true? It isn't true in general for dependent types (consider, for example, a function which computes a simple type) and certainly not with more aggressive dependency erasure such as forcing of constructor arguments which is implemented in Agda and Idris, for example.

        
p9 It seems that the type system is strong enough to support some optimisations on pattern match compilation - such as Epigram's detagging, where the result of a case split on one value informs what another value should be.

        
In related work, you don't mention any other compilers for dependently typed languages which have to tackle similar problems, though you do mention program extraction for Coq. There is also MAlonzo, which translates Agda to Haskell, and Epic (Trends in Functional Programming), used by Epigram, Agda and Idris, which deals with naming though in a much more limited way than this paper.},

This paper gives a control flow analysis for polymorphic functional programs (specifically System F with recursion). Surprisingly (to me at least) this appears not to have been done before, with previous analyses targetting dynamically typed or simply typed languages, or handling polymorphism by explicitly eliminating it. It seems to be a worthwhile exercise: richer static type systems should give more information to support static analysis.

        
While I like what is achieved by this paper, I did find it rather hard going. The introduction feels laboured and then the paper covers a lot of detail (possibly too much) in quite a short space (though it still runs to 18 pages, two more than the limit!). I would suggest that the paper would be much improved, particularly to a non-expert reader, if it give one or more motivating examples in the introduction and showed how the analysis applied to these examples, when translated to ANF.
I think this would shorten the introduction and give a much better intuition for the rules.},

@article{McBride2004a,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Pattern matching has proved an extremely powerful and durable notion in functional programming. This paper contributes a new programming notation for type theory which elaborates the notion in various ways. First, as is by now quite well-known in the type theory community, definition by pattern matching becomes a more discriminating tool in the presence of dependent types, since it refines the explanation of types as well as values. This becomes all the more true in the presence of the rich class of datatypes known as inductive families (Dybjer, 1991). Secondly, as proposed by Peyton Jones (1997) for Haskell, and independently rediscovered by us, subsidiary case analyses on the results of intermediate computations, which commonly take place on the right-hand side of definitions by pattern matching, should rather be handled on the left. In simply-typed languages, this subsumes the trivial case of Boolean guards; in our setting it becomes yet more powerful. Thirdly, elementary pattern matching decompositions have a well-defined interface given by a dependent type; they correspond to the statement of an induction principle for the datatype. More general, user-definable decompositions may be defined which also have types of the same general form. Elementary pattern matching may therefore be recast in abstract form, with a semantics given by translation. Such abstract decompositions of data generalize Wadler&apos;s (1987) notion of &lsquo;view&rsquo;. The programmer wishing to introduce a new view of a type mathitT, and exploit it directly in pattern matching, may do so via a standard programming idiom. The type theorist, looking through the Curry&ndash;Howard lens, may see this as proving a theorem, one which establishes the validity of a new induction principle for mathitT. We develop enough syntax and semantics to account for this high-level style of programming in dependent type theory. We close with the development of a typechecker for the simply-typed lambda calculus, which furnishes a view of raw terms as either being well-typed, or containing an error. The implementation of this view is ipso facto a proof that typechecking is decidable.},

abstract = {Sized types are a modular and theoretically well-understood tool for checking termination of recursive and productivity of corecursive definitions. The essential idea is to track structural descent and guardedness in the type system to make termination checking robust and suitable for strong abstractions like higher-order functions and polymorphism. To study the application of sized types to proof assistants and programming languages based on dependent type theory, we have implemented a core language, MiniAgda, with explicit handling of sizes. New considerations were necessary to soundly integrate sized types with dependencies and pattern matching, which was made possible by concepts such as inaccessible patterns and parametric function spaces. This paper provides an introduction to MiniAgda by example and informal explanations of the underlying principles.},

Nice introduction to the language, easy for a Haskell programmer to follow, and nice explanation of how it works motivating the problem. But I find it hard to tell what in the paper is already known and what is a specific contribution.

        
Functional patterns look nice, if hard to implement. Related to views? Limitations?
Could these techniques improve (compile-time) unification in dependently typed languages?

annote = {This paper tackles an interesting problem, namely that of building DSLs independently which are nevertheless composable (at least as far as parsing goes). The claim is that the approach taken - using type based disambiguation - can combine the good features of internal and external DSLs - namely, that they become easier to implement, and have a nice syntax.

        
I found the paper interesting to read, the contribution worthwhile and the results convincing, though I have a few suggestions for preparing the paper for TFP submission, since it wouldn't be possible to accept it in its current form.

        
Perhaps most importantly, the draft submission is in the SIGPLAN format, which means you've used a lot more space than you have available. I find that 1 SIGPLAN page becomes at least 2 in Springer format because of font size and margins, so you'll need to think carefully about what you consider the most important contribution of the paper, how much detail you can go into, and how many examples to give. 
If it helps, I think you could reduce section 5 to just a short sketch of Typed Racket and there'd be enough of a contribution to justify a TFP paper (though of course I can't speak for other potential referees!)

        
I found the paper a bit difficult to read at first since I don't have a detailed understand of parsing algorithms, and I suspect I won't be alone in this among the TFP readership. It would be useful to say more in the introduction about island parsing, and what a chart parsing strategy is. An intuitive explanation of the various parsing algorithms you give formally (Example 2.3, say) would be very useful for this (possibly even more useful than the formal descriptions...).

        
Another advantage of internal DSLs that I didn't see mentioned explicitly in the paper is that many features of the host language - syntax, code generation, type checking - are available for free, but have to be implemented explicitly for an external DSL. Maybe this is part of what you mean by interoperability. There is more than parsing needed for this though.

        
A question on contribution 1: how realistic is it to assume that nonterminals are largely disjoint? I could imagine, say, function calls or arithmetic being part of multiple DSLs if not factored out. Or have I misunderstood what you mean?

        
Some modern languages with dependent types have systems for syntax extension, e.g. Agda has mixfix declarations, Idris has syntax rules, type-directed elaboration and overloaded variable bindings. I wonder, therefore, if your approach to parsing could be better integrated into this kind of language, where embedded verifiable DSLs seem to be an obvious application. The Typed Racket example suggests to me that this would be an interesting thing to explore.},

annote = {This paper describes a language, Jeeves, for describing privacy policies and ensuring that they are automatically enforced. It gives the semantics of Jeeves in terms of a translation to a target language $\lambda_J$ and shows how to implement the privacy rules in a monadic style in Haskell which captures the constraint propagation.

        
Capturing policy rules in this way is an interesting idea and the monadic definition of constraint propagation is natural, but unfortunately the paper itself only seems half-written. I found the website (https://sites.google.com/site/jeevesprogramming/) and the tutorial there much more enlightening! Perhaps relating the implementation to some more extensive examples would be helpful, illustrating how the Haskell code relates to Jeeves programs. This would be particularly valuable in sections 3 and 5, and there is plenty of space available for this.

        
The paper could use a thorough proof read and spell check. For example:

        
end of sec 1 - references for the report and web site would be useful here.
End of sec 2: privacy politics? This is the only place this phrase is used.

        
p2 etal => et al

        
"The program read" => "The program reads"
"Depending on what" => comma before this
"bottem" => "bottom"

        
p4 "Eventhough" => "Even though"
"The program body, consist" => "The program body consists"

        
"but without any substantial..." - there is a missing word here

        
The presentation of Sec 5 is untidy - for example a section heading at the end of the page and bad spacing between subsections.

        
Reference 1 is blank

The PADS/ML design includes features such as dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a concise, easy-to-read notation. The PADS/ML implementation compiles these descriptions into ml structures and functors that include types for parsed data, functions for parsing and printing, and auxiliary support for user-specified, format-dependent and format-independent tool generation.},

abstract = {Cayenne is a Haskell-like language. The main difference between Haskell and Cayenne is that Cayenne has dependent types, i.e., the result type of a function may depend on the argument value , and types of record components (which can be types or values) may depend on other components. Cayenne also combines the syntactic categories for value expressions and type expressions; thus reducing the number of language concepts. Having dependent types and combined type and value expressions makes the language very powerful. It is powerful enough that a special module concept is unnecessary; ordinary records suffice. It is also powerful enough to encode predicate logic at the type level, allowing types to be used as specifications of programs. However, this power comes at a cost: type checking of Cayenne is undecidable. While this may appear to be a steep price to pay, it seems to work well in practice.},

Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.},

It presents a neat example of program calculation and reasoning with each step in the calculation explained precisely - indeed the interesting thing to me is the calculation, rather than the problem itself, and it is nice that this works for an algorithm which requires in-place update (even if it does involve pretending // is in-place!).

        
I'm not totally convinced about the condition of the algorithm being "discovered in a disciplined manner" since many of the steps in the calculation required some insight, but others will disagree and I don't think it really matters for the main point of this paper in any case - the point is the calculational development, which is sufficiently detailed that a careful reader should be able to develop that insight, with practice. I would recommend this paper for acceptance in its current form. },

abstract = {The recent success of languages like Agda and Coq demonstrates the potential of using dependent types for programming. These systems rely on many high-level features like datatype definitions, pattern matching and implicit arguments to facilitate the use of the languages. However, these features complicate the metatheoretical study and are a potential source of bugs. To address these issues we introduce $\Pi$$\Sigma$, a dependently typed core language. It is small enough for metatheoretical study and the type checker is small enough to be formally verified. In this language there is only one mechanism for recursionused for types, functions and infinite objectsand an explicit mechanism to control unfolding, based on lifted types. Furthermore structural equality is used consistently for values and types; this is achieved by a new notion of $\alpha$-equality for recursive definitions. We show, by translating several high-level constructions, that $\Pi$$\Sigma$ is suitable as a core language for dependently typed programming.},

This paper gives a type inference algorithm for Java extended with lambdas, extending earlier work on type inference for a small functional language with subtyping. It is interesting to see how this could work, and I'm sure this would be a welcome addition to Java. However, I didn't find the paper very well organised or presented so it was difficult to get very much from it. There is too much unnecessary detail (such as fragments of the parser or complete sets of coercions and substitutions) and not enough useful context such as syntax of Java_lambda with its typing rules.

        
If there is an implementation, it would also be good to give a url to download it so that the reader can try out some of the ideas given in the paper, and try to reproduce your results!

        
Other comments:

        
p1 The opening sentences don't seem to make sense on their own. It would be useful to know what your language in [7] is.

        
There are several typos which suggest that the paper could use a proof read and spell check. For example:
p2 "The improvement is that, that" => remove a "that"
"not necessary" => "not necessarily"
"can also consists" => "can also consist"
"remainig" => "remaining"

        
p3 What does "The concrete syntax [...] is oriented at [3]" mean? Is the syntax defined in this reference? It would be better to give it explicitly to make the paper more self contained.

        
p4 Is there some reason that you use tuples in the representation of classes, functions and expressions?

        
p9 "Decomposition: ..." I don't understand this sentence.

        
p10 "corecions" => "coercions" (several times)
also "coersions" => "coercions"

        
p14 (and other places similarly) I don't think it helps much to give the full set of substitutions here. A representative selection at most should be fine.

This paper is a case study in dependently typed programming, investigating how an existing Haskell library (Accelerate) could benefit from dependent types by implementing a version of the library in Agda. The Haskell version is a generative library, meaning that programs are constructed as Haskell ADTs, then compiled to code which will run on a GPU. The authos observe that type correctness of Accelerate programs is checked statically, as far as possible, by using advanced features of the Haskell type system such as GADTs, and hypothesise that a language with a stronger type system such as Agda would increase the static guarantees which are expressible.

        
This is an interesting question, well worth asking, and the paper presents mixed results. The presentation of the Agda version is clear, and the relationship with the Haskell version is easy to see. However, some properties which one might hope to express turn out to be difficult in the current form. One conclusion I would draw from this is that to use dependent types well involves more than simply annotating an existing program.  The difficulties with filter and fold in particular show that care must be taken to preserve information required for checking later.

        
I wonder if the work has become too constrained by porting directly from the Haskell implementation. Perhaps a question to ask in future work would be - what would a dependently typed API to GPUs look like? What properties do we want to capture, and how can we do so with minimal work for the programmer?

        
Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading the paper and I think this is a good first step towards data parallel programming with dependent types.

        
Minor comments:

        
p3 Given that proceedings are in black and white, maybe it'd be more distinctive to put the Haskell code in a box rather than just a vertical bar?

        
p8 It would be useful to see the type of the zipWith function which corresponds to the Haskell version, if not the implementation (which I suspect is a little tricky).

        
p9 Probably not relevant to this paper, but this comment about properties of floating point arithmetic makes me wonder if it'd be possible to represent floating point error bounds in the type to recover these properties. 

        
p10 Another alternative for the type of filter could be a type level function to calculate the length. However, this would probably make proofs even harder. I think this is evidence that dependently typed programming is more than Haskell plus extra type annotations!

abstract = {In these lecture notes we give an introduction to functional programming with dependent types. We use the dependently typed programming language Agda which is based on ideas in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory and Martin-L\"{o}fs logical framework. We begin by showing how to do simply typed functional programming, and discuss the differences between Agdas type system and the Hindley-Milner type system, which underlies mainstream typed functional programming languages like Haskell and ML. We then show how to employ dependent types for programming with functional data structures such as vectors and binary search trees. We go on to explain the Curry-Howard identification of propositions and types, and how it makes Agda not only a programming language but also a programming logic. According to Curry-Howard, we also identify programs and proofs, something which is possible only by requiring that all program terminate. However, we show in the final section a method for encoding general and possibly partial recursive functions as total functions using dependent types.},

abstract = {Haskell benefits from a sophisticated type system, but implementors, programmers, and researchers suffer because it has no formal description. To remedy this shortcoming, we present a Haskell program that implements a Haskell typechecker, thus providing a mathematically rigorous specification in a notation that is familiar to Haskell users. We expect this program to fill a serious gap in current descriptions of Haskell, both as a starting point for discussions about existing features of the type system, and as a platform from which to explore new proposals.},

@article{Reynolds1972,
abstract = {Higher-order programming languages (i.e., languages in which procedures or labels can occur as values) are usually defined by interpreters which are themselves written in a programming language based on the lambda calculus (i.e., an applicative language such as pure LISP). Examples include McCarthy's definition of LISP, Landin's SECD machine, the Vienna definition of PL/I, Reynolds' definitions of GEDANKEN, and recent unpublished work by L. Morris and C. Wadsworth. Such definitions can be classified according to whether the interpreter contains higher-order functions, and whether the order of application (i.e., call-by-value versus call-by-name) in the defined language depends upon the order of application in the defining language. As an example, we consider the definition of a simple applicative programming language by means of an interpreter written in a similar language. Definitions in each of the above classifications are derived from one another by informal but constructive methods. The treatment of imperative features such as jumps and assignment is also discussed.},

@article{Bird2012,
annote = {I enjoyed reading this pearl. It describes, clearly and concisely, the calculation of a program for changing the way of representing a graph in response to a challenge of Donald Knuth's, who asked whether such an algorithm could be discovered in a "disciplined manner". The paper describes that disciplined manner.

        

        
In general, I found the paper easy to follow. Section 2 sets up the problem, giving a purely functional representation of graphs and the definitions of some basic, important functions, in particular encode and decode. Section 3 gives a first example of program calculation, assuming the existence of a function 'lengthen' corresponding to 'shorten' and deriving an implementation from its required properties. Later, we see a definition using arrays rather than lists in order to improve the complexity to linear time. Section 4 addresses a condition Knuth imposes, namely that update must be in place and gives an imperative translation.

        
I think this paper gives a nice example of program calculation leading from a functional specification to an imperative program. I do have a few suggestions though which I think would improve the paper:

        
In the introduction, you say there is a reason why the code cannot be purely functional, but I don't see an explicit explanation of why this is. In place update perhaps? Can this be clarified?

        
The equation numbering, e.g. (1) at the bottom of p1 - some equations are clearly important and referred to elsewhere, such as this one. Is it possible to make these stand out more? e.g. with an explicit heading "Equation 1"?

        
p3 In the first examples of program calculation, it is easy to follow the reasoning of why the calculation is correct, but it is not so obvious what the insight was that led to the calculation. Is this simply a matter of experience?

        
p6 I'm surprised to read that // updates an array in place. Is this really what is happening or is there a clever representation of Data.Array.Diff? It appears to use IO operations internally. So it might be nice to say a little more about what is really going on.

        
p7 "...an observation that could have been made earlier" seems an odd thing to say. Why not either make it earlier, or just make it here where it is used?

        
p9 There is no need to give the translation rules to the imperative code in detail, but it would still be useful to sketch what is going on. It seems that the foldr becomes the outer for loop, and apply the inner for loop. It would also be useful, in Figs 1-4 to give the functional code alongside the imperative versions. It is interesting to examine how the mapping works and I think an important point made by the paper (as indeed you say in the conclusion).

        
p14 The last paragraph appears to be largely a comment to the present referees!

The paper describes Nax, a new functional programming language with term indices which supports logical consistency and Hindley-Milner style type inference. The authors give four key features of Nax (1: strong normalization, 2: type inference, 3: expressivity and 4: support for term indices) and give several examples to demonstrate the simplicity of programming in Nax as compared with Haskell and Agda. Three examples are given, in each language: a type preserving evaluator for an expression language, a generic Path datatype which describes a path through an index type, and a stack safe compiler for the expression language.

        
Presenting examples in this way gives a nice introduction to Nax, in that they are well understood examples already and it is easy to relate them to implementations with which the reader is already familiar. On the other hand, this leads to my main problem with this paper: it doesn't really tell us anything we don't already know, and the promising things about Nax which *would* be an interesting contribution are left out of the paper.

        
Of the four features of Nax given above, 1 and 2 are described as "beyond the scope of this paper" which is a shame because these are the things I'm most interested in hearing about! Existing dependently typed languages lack type inference, and whlie I would argue that it is usually best to write types first in any case, there are still many situations where recovering type inference would be useful - typically small or simply typed helper functions. So this would have been a very nice technical contribution.

        
The third feature (expressivity) is one that the authors claim as a contribution of the paper. They claim that programming in Nax is as "simple" as programming in Haskell or Agda. However, I think this is a strong claim to make given the available evidence - it is quite subjective. I agree that the programs are quite easy to read, but to say that *programming* is as simple really requires some externally verified evidence from other programmers! It seems to me that programming with Mendler-style combinators may take some practice, for example.

        
In summary, I do like the idea behind Nax and some of its features sound as if they could be interesting, and I think this latest contribution to the design space of dependently typed functional programming is welcome. But this paper does not really provide any new insights as it stands.

abstract = {We begin by revisiting the idea of using a universe of types to write generic programs in a dependently typed setting by constructing a universe for Strictly Positive Types (SPTs). Here we extend this construction to cover dependent types, i.e. Strictly Positive Families (SPFs), thereby fixing a gap left open in previous work. Using the approach presented here we are able to represent all of Epigrams datatypes within Epigram including the universe of datatypes itself.},
