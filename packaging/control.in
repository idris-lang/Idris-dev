Description: Idris is a general purpose language with full dependent types.
             It is compiled, with eager evaluation.
             Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values,
             meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour can be
             specified precisely in the type. The language is closely
             related to Epigram and Agda. There is a tutorial at
             <https://www.idris-lang.org/documentation>.
