Benchmarks
----------

To run:

$ ./build   -- builds all benchmark binaries
$ ./run     -- runs all benchmarks

Adding a test
-------------

Add a line to the 'ALL' file of the following form:

dir/main   arg

where 'dir' is the directory the benchmark lives in, 'main' is the name of the
ipkg file and executable (these must be the same), 'arg' is the input to give
to the binary.

It is assumed that all benchmarks take exactly one argument, which helps to
ensure that they are not simply doing all the work at compile time.
