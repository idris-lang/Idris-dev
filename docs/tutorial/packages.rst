Packages
========

``Idris`` includes a simple system for building packages from a
package description file. These files can be used with the ``Idris``
compiler to manage the development process of your ``Idris``
programmes and packages.

Package Descriptions
--------------------

A package description includes the following:

+ A header, consisting of the keyword package followed by the package name.
+ Fields describing package contents, ``<field> = <value>``

At least one field must be the modules field, where the value is a
comma separated list of modules.  For example, a library test which
has two modules ``foo.idr`` and ``bar.idr`` as source files would be
written as follows::

    package foo

    modules = foo, bar

Other examples of package files can be found in the ``libs`` directory
of the main ``Idris`` repository, and in `third-party libraries <https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Libraries>`_.

Other common fields which may be present in an ``ipkg`` file are:

+ ``sourcedir = <dir>``, which gives the directory (relative to the
  current directory) which contains the source. Default is the current
  directory.

+ ``executable = <output>``, which gives the name of the executable
  file to generate.

+ ``main = <module>``, which gives the name of the main module, and
  must be present if the executable field is present.

+ ``opts = "<idris options>"``, which allows options (such as other
  packages) to be passed to ``Idris``.

In more advanced cases, particularly to support creating bindings to
external ``C`` libraries, the following options are available:

+ ``makefile = <file>``, which specifies a ``Makefile``, to be built
  before the ``Idris`` modules, for example to support linking with a
  ``C`` library.

+ ``libs = <libs>``, which gives a comma separated list of libraries
  which must be present for the package to be usable.

+ ``objs = <objs>``, which gives a comma separated list of additional
  object files to be installed, perhaps generated by the ``Makefile``.

Using Package files
-------------------

Given an ``Idris`` package file ``text.ipkg`` it can be used with the ``Idris`` compiler as follows:

+ ``idris --build test.ipkg`` will build all modules in the package

+ ``idris --install test.ipkg`` will install the package, making it
  accessible by other ``Idris`` libraries and programs.

+ ``idris --clean test.ipkg`` will delete all intermediate code and
  executable files generated when building.

Once the test package has been installed, the command line option
``--package test`` makes it accessible (abbreviated to ``-p test``).
For example::

    idris -p test Main.idr
