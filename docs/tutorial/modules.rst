Modules and Namespaces
**********************

An Idris program consists of a collection of modules. Each module
includes an optional ``module`` declaration giving the name of the
module, a list of ``import`` statements giving the other modules which
are to be imported, and a collection of declarations and definitions of
types, interfaces and functions. For example, the listing below gives a
module which defines a binary tree type ``BTree`` (in a file
``Btree.idr``):

.. code-block:: idris

    module Btree

    public export
    data BTree a = Leaf
                 | Node (BTree a) a (BTree a)

    export
    insert : Ord a => a -> BTree a -> BTree a
    insert x Leaf = Node Leaf x Leaf
    insert x (Node l v r) = if (x < v) then (Node (insert x l) v r)
                                       else (Node l v (insert x r))

    export
    toList : BTree a -> List a
    toList Leaf = []
    toList (Node l v r) = Btree.toList l ++ (v :: Btree.toList r)

    export
    toTree : Ord a => List a -> BTree a
    toTree [] = Leaf
    toTree (x :: xs) = insert x (toTree xs)

The modifiers ``export`` and ``public export`` say which names are visible
from other modules. These are explained further below.

Then, this gives a main program (in a file
``bmain.idr``) which uses the ``Btree`` module to sort a list:

.. code-block:: idris

    module Main

    import Btree

    main : IO ()
    main = do let t = toTree [1,8,2,7,9,3]
              print (Btree.toList t)

The same names can be defined in multiple modules: names are *qualified* with
the name of the module. The names defined in the ``Btree`` module are, in full:

+ ``Btree.BTree``
+ ``Btree.Leaf``
+ ``Btree.Node``
+ ``Btree.insert``
+ ``Btree.toList``
+ ``Btree.toTree``

If names are otherwise unambiguous, there is no need to give the fully
qualified name. Names can be disambiguated either by giving an explicit
qualification, or according to their type.

There is no formal link between the module name and its filename,
although it is generally advisable to use the same name for each. An
``import`` statement refers to a filename, using dots to separate
directories. For example, ``import foo.bar`` would import the file
``foo/bar.idr``, which would conventionally have the module declaration
``module foo.bar``. The only requirement for module names is that the
main module, with the ``main`` function, must be called
``Main`` â€” although its filename need not be ``Main.idr``.

Export Modifiers
================

Idris allows for fine-grained control over the visibility of a
module's contents. By default, all names defined in a module are kept
private.  This aides in specification of a minimal interface and for
internal details to be left hidden. Idris allows for functions,
types, and interfaces to be marked as: ``private``, ``export``, or
``public export``. Their general meaning is as follows:

- ``private`` meaning that it's not exported at all. This is the default.

- ``export`` meaning that its top level type is exported.

- ``public export`` meaning that the entire definition is exported.

A further restriction in modifying the visibility is that definitions
must not refer to anything within a lower level of visibility. For
example, ``public export`` definitions cannot use private names, and
``export`` types cannot use private names. This is to prevent private
names leaking into a module's interface.

Meaning for Functions
---------------------

- ``export`` the type is exported

- ``public export`` the type and definition are exported, and the
  definition can be used after it is imported. In other words, the
  definition itself is considered part of the module's interface. The
  long name ``public export`` is intended to make you think twice
  about doing this.

.. note::

   Type synonyms in Idris are created by writing a function. When
   setting the visibility for a module, it might be a good idea to
   ``public export`` all type synonyms if they are to be used outside
   the module. Otherwise, Idris won't know what the synonym is a
   synonym for.

Since ``public export`` means that a function's definition is exported,
this effectively makes the function definition part of the module's API.
Therefore, it's generally a good idea to avoid using ``public export`` for
functions unless you really mean to export the full definition.

Meaning for Data Types
----------------------

For data types, the meanings are:

- ``export`` the type constructor is exported

- ``public export`` the type constructor and data constructors are exported


Meaning for Interfaces
----------------------

For interfaces, the meanings are:

- ``export`` the interface name is exported

- ``public export`` the interface name, method names and default
  definitions are exported

``%access`` Directive
----------------------

The default export mode can be changed with the ``%access``
directive, for example:

.. code-block:: idris

    module Btree

    %access export

    public export
    data BTree a = Leaf
                 | Node (BTree a) a (BTree a)

    insert : Ord a => a -> BTree a -> BTree a
    insert x Leaf = Node Leaf x Leaf
    insert x (Node l v r) = if (x < v) then (Node (insert x l) v r)
                                       else (Node l v (insert x r))

    toList : BTree a -> List a
    toList Leaf = []
    toList (Node l v r) = Btree.toList l ++ (v :: Btree.toList r)

    toTree : Ord a => List a -> BTree a
    toTree [] = Leaf
    toTree (x :: xs) = insert x (toTree xs)

In this case, any function with no access modifier will be exported as
``export``, rather than left ``private``.

Propagating Inner Module API's
-------------------------------

Additionally, a module can re-export a module it has imported, by using
the ``public`` modifier on an ``import``. For example:

.. code-block:: idris

    module A

    import B
    import public C

The module ``A`` will export the name ``a``, as well as any public or
abstract names in module ``C``, but will not re-export anything from
module ``B``.

Explicit Namespaces
===================

Defining a module also defines a namespace implicitly. However,
namespaces can also be given *explicitly*. This is most useful if you
wish to overload names within the same module:

.. code-block:: idris

    module Foo

    namespace x
      test : Int -> Int
      test x = x * 2

    namespace y
      test : String -> String
      test x = x ++ x

This (admittedly contrived) module defines two functions with fully
qualified names ``Foo.x.test`` and ``Foo.y.test``, which can be
disambiguated by their types:

::

    *Foo> test 3
    6 : Int
    *Foo> test "foo"
    "foofoo" : String

Parameterised blocks
====================

Groups of functions can be parameterised over a number of arguments
using a ``parameters`` declaration, for example:

.. code-block:: idris

    parameters (x : Nat, y : Nat)
      addAll : Nat -> Nat
      addAll z = x + y + z

The effect of a ``parameters`` block is to add the declared parameters
to every function, type and data constructor within the
block. Specifically, adding the parameters to the front of the
argument list. Outside the block, the parameters must be given
explicitly. The ``addAll`` function, when called from the REPL, will
thus have the following type signature.

::

    *params> :t addAll
    addAll : Nat -> Nat -> Nat -> Nat

and the following definition.

.. code-block:: idris

    addAll : (x : Nat) -> (y : Nat) -> (z : Nat) -> Nat
    addAll x y z = x + y + z

Parameters blocks can be nested, and can also include data declarations,
in which case the parameters are added explicitly to all type and data
constructors. They may also be dependent types with implicit arguments:

.. code-block:: idris

    parameters (y : Nat, xs : Vect x a)
      data Vects : Type -> Type where
        MkVects : Vect y a -> Vects a

      append : Vects a -> Vect (x + y) a
      append (MkVects ys) = xs ++ ys

To use ``Vects`` or ``append`` outside the block, we must also give the
``xs`` and ``y`` arguments. Here, we can use placeholders for the values
which can be inferred by the type checker:

::

    *params> show (append _ _ (MkVects _ [1,2,3] [4,5,6]))
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]" : String
