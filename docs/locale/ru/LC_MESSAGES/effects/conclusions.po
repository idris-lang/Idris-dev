"This tutorial has given an introduction to writing and reasoning about side-"
"effecting programs in Idris, using the ``Effects`` library. More details "
"about the *implementation* of the library, such as how ``run`` works, how "
"handlers are invoked, etc, are given in a separate paper [1]_."

"The inspiration for the ``Effects`` library was Bauer and Pretnar’s Eff "
"language [2]_, which describes a langauge based on algebraic effects and "
"handlers.  Other recent languages and libraries have also been built on this"
" ideas, for example [3]_ and [4]_. The theoretical foundations are also "
"well-studied see [5]_, [6]_, [7]_, [8]_."
