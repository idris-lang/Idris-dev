Idris (http://idris-lang.org/) is a general-purpose functional programming
language with dependent types.

## Installation Guides.

This repository represents the latest development version of the
language, and may contain bugs that are being actively worked on.  For
those who wish to use a more stable version of Idris please consider
installing the latest version that has been released on Hackage.
Installation instructions for various platforms can be
[found on the Idris Wiki](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Installation-Instructions).

More information about building Idris from source has been detailed in the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)

## Code Generation

Idris has support for external code generators. Supplied with the distribution
is a C code generator to compile executables, and a JavaScript code generator
with support for node.js and browser JavaScript.

At this moment in time there are two external repositories with a
[Java code generator](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-java) and an
[LLVM-based code generator](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-llvm).
